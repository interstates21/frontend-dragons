            <p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that
                certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.[1] NFTs can be used to
                represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of
                the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital
                items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a
                proof of ownership that is separate from copyright.

                In 2021, there has been increased interest in using NFTs. Blockchains like Ethereum, Flow, and Tezos
                have their own standards when it comes to supporting NFTs, but each works to ensure that the digital
                item represented is authentically one-of-a-kind. NFTs are now being used to commodify digital assets in
                art, music, sports, and other popular entertainment. Most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain;
                however, other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs.[2]

                The NFT market value tripled in 2020, reaching more than $250 million.[3] The rise of NFT transactions
                has also led to increased environmental criticism. The computation-heavy processes associated with
                proof-of-work blockchains, the type primarily used for NFTs, require high energy inputs that are
                contributing to global warming. The carbon emissions produced by the energy needed to maintain these
                blockchains has forced some in the NFT market to rethink their carbon footprint.</p>

                A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that
                certifies any digital file to be unique.[4] An NFT functions like a cryptographic token, but unlike
                cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, are not mutually interchangeable, in other words, not fungible.[5]
                NFTs are created when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash, a set of characters that
                verifies a set of data to be unique, onto previous records therefore creating a chain of identifiable
                data blocks.[6] This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of each digital file
                by providing a digital signature that is used to track NFT ownership.[6] However, data links that point
                to details like where the art is stored can die.[7] Also, ownership of an NFT does not inherently grant
                copyright to whatever digital asset the token represents.[8] While someone may sell an NFT representing
                their work, the buyer will not necessarily receive copyright privileges when ownership of the NFT is
                changed and so the original owner is allowed to create more NFTs of the same work.[9][10] In that sense,
                an NFT is merely a proof of ownership that is separate from a copyright.[11][12]
                <span class="highlight">Digital art was an early use case for NFTs, because of the ability of blockchain
                    technology to assure the unique signature and ownership of NFTs.[15] Digital artwork entitled
                    "Everydays - The First 5000 Days", by artist Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, sold for US$69.3
                    million in 2021.[16][17] The purchase resulted in the third-highest auction price achieved for a
                    living artist, after Jeff Koons and David Hockney. Another Beeple piece entitled "Crossroad",
                    consisting of a 10-second video showing animated pedestrians walking past a figure of Donald J.
                    Trump, sold for US$6.6 million at Nifty Gateway, an online cryptocurrency marketplace for digital
                    art.[18][19]
                </span> Figma CEO Dylan Field, sold a digital avatar entitled "CryptoPunk #7804" for US$7.5 million to
                an anonymous investor, as well as a second avatar "Ape, Fedora #6965" for US$1.5 million in February
                2021.[20]

            <p>NFTs can also be used to represent in-game assets, such as digital plots of land, which are controlled by
                the user instead of the game developer. NFTs allow assets to be traded on third-party marketplaces
                without permission from the game developer. In February 2021, Axie Infinity recorded a sale of $1.5
                million for digital land titles in a single sale.[28]
