   <header>A theft, three auctions and a digital reunion: the
    unfinished story of Isaac Newton’s wandering
    Swedish autograph album inscription</header>
   <div class="container" ><main>
        <p>A very small collection of the smallest kind of Newton manuscript
        As part of my work for the Newton Project, since the late 1990s, I along with other colleagues
        have tracked auctions of Newton manuscripts.* The bulk of Newton’s non-scientific papers
        flooded the market after they were sold in 1936 at a Sotheby’s auction in London. Since then,
        almost all the large and even medium-size manuscripts have safely settled in university and other
        professional repositories or are otherwise known through photographs and transcriptions. The
        Newton Project1
        and The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project2 have transcribed most of the
        theological, prophetic and alchemical texts. The Newton Project has also begun working on
        Newton’s Mint Papers. We now have access to almost everything Newton wrote that has
        survived the test of time</p>
        <p>So these days we are left with monitoring small fragments that occasionally appear in the
            auction trade. But even a tiny scrap of Newton’s writing can sometimes reveal important
            information. An ever-active eagle eye can reap scholarly dividends as we continue to sharpen
            our understanding of Newton’s thought. <span class="highlight">The 1936 Sotheby’s auction catalogue provides an
            impressively detailed listing of the manuscripts offered at that sale. This allows us to identify
            manuscripts and portions of manuscripts that appear today in auctions with what was dispersed
            at the 1936 sale.</span> By convention, Newton scholars refer to these manuscripts by their 1936
            Sotheby lot numbers.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, however, we are surprised by small Newton manuscripts that do not descend
                from the 1936 sale and whose existence is therefore previously unknown. What I want to tell
                here is a story—as yet incomplete—that relates to a very small collection of Newton’s smallest
                manuscripts that, moreover, were technically never in his possession. Small though they be and
                few in number, they offer value in shining light on Newton’s sense of who he was and how he
                wanted to be remembered. They have hitherto escaped scrutiny by Newton scholars.</p>
