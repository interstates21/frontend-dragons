                History of fujifilm
            </h2>
            <p class="text-primary">
                Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. was established in 1934 as a subsidiary of Daicel with the aim of producing
                photographic films. Over the following 10 years, the company produced photographic films, motion-picture
                films and X-ray films. In the 1940s, Fuji Photo entered the optical glasses, lenses and equipment
                markets.
                After the Second World War, Fuji Photo diversified, penetrating the medical (X-ray diagnosis), printing,
                electronic imaging and magnetic materials fields. In 1962, Fuji Photo and UK-based Rank Xerox Limited
                (now
                Xerox Limited) launched Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd. through a joint venture.

                    From the mid-1950s, Fuji Photo accelerated the establishment of overseas sales bases. In the 1980s,
                    Fuji
                </span>
                Photo expanded its production and other bases overseas, stepping up the pace of its business
                globalization.
                Meanwhile, Fuji Photo developed digital technologies for its photo-related, medical and printing
                businesses.
                As a result, it invented computed radiography (CR), which solved a number of issues of traditional
                radiography, resulting a decrease of radiation exposure to both technician and patient. Fujifilm's
                systems
                were marketed and sold under the FCR brand.[12]

                Like its rival Eastman Kodak which dominated in the US, Fuji Photo enjoyed a longtime near-monopoly on
                camera film in Japan. By becoming one of the title sponsors of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics (an
                opportunity
                that Kodak passed on), offering cheaper camera film, and establishing a film factory in the US, Fuji
                gained
                considerable market share there, while Kodak had little success in penetrating Japan. In May 1995, Kodak
                filed a petition with the US Commerce Department under section 301 of the Commerce Act arguing that its
                poor
                performance in the Japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by Fuji. The
                complaint
                was lodged by the US with the World Trade Organization. On January 30, 1998, the WTO announced a
                "sweeping
                rejection of Kodak's complaints" about the film market in Japan.[13][14]

                The new millennium witnessed the rapid spread of digital technology, and demand for photographic films
                plunged in line with the growing popularity of digital cameras. In response, Fuji Photo implemented
                management reforms aimed at drastic transformation of its business structures. Even as early as the
                1980s, the company had foreseen the switch from film to digital, so "it developed a three-pronged
                strategy: to squeeze as much money out of the film business as possible, to prepare for the switch to
                digital and to develop new business lines." While both film manufacturers recognized this fundamental
                change, Fuji Photo adapted to this shift much more successfully[13] than Eastman Kodak (which filed for
                bankruptcy in January 2012). Fuji Photo's diversification efforts also succeeded while Kodak's had
                failed; furthermore Kodak built up a large but barely profitable digital camera business that was undone
                quickly by smartphone cameras.[13]

                <span class="italic">
                    In March 2006, Noritsu and Fuji announced a strategic alliance for Noritsu to manufactures all of
                    Fuji's
                    photofinishing hardware, such as minilabs. Each company produces its own software for the
                    minilabs.[15]
                </span>

                On September 19, 2006, Fujifilm announced plans to establish a holding company, Fujifilm Holdings Corp.
                Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox would become subsidiaries of the holding company. A representative of the
                company reconfirmed its commitment to film, which accounts for 3% of sales.[16]

                On January 31, 2018, Fujifilm announced that it would acquire a 50.1% controlling stake in Xerox for
                US$6.1 billion, which will be amalgamated into its existing Fuji Xerox business.[17][18][19] The deal
                was subsequently dropped after intervention by activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.[20] In
                late 2019, Fujifilm announced its acquisition of Xerox's 25% stake in the 57-year-old joint venture,
                Fuji Xerox.[21]

                In December 2019, Fujifilm acquired Hitachi's diagnostic imaging business for US$1.63 billion.[3]

                Amid the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, one of Fujifilm Toyama Chemical drugs, i.e. favipiravir, an antiviral
                commercially named Avigan, is being considered as a possible cure to the virus,[8][22] after having been
                approved by China, Russia, and Indonesia authorities by June 2020.

                In June 2020, Fujifilm announced a US$928 million investment to a Denmark-based biologics production
                facility, which it acquired from Biogen a year earlier for around US$890 million, to double the
                manufacturing capacity.[23] A tape cartridge using strontium ferrite that could store up to 400TB was
