                Sweden <span class="italic"> (/ˈswiː.dən/; Swedish: Sverige [ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (About this soundlisten))</span>,
                officially the Kingdom of
                Sweden <span class="italic">(Swedish: Konungariket Sverige [ˈkôːnɵŋaˌriːkɛt ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (About this
                    soundlisten)),</span> is a Nordic
                country in Northern Europe. <br>
                It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east, and is
                connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund Strait. At 450,295 square
                kilometres (173,860 sq mi),<span class="highlight2"> Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe,
                    the third-largest country
                    in the European Union, and the fifth largest country in Europe.</span><br><br>
            <h4>The capital city is Stockholm.</h4>
            Sweden has a total population of 10.4 million and a low population density of 25 inhabitants per square
            kilometre (65/sq mi).<br><br>
            <span class="larger-text"> 87% of Swedes live in urban areas, which cover 1.5% of the entire land area. The
                highest concentration is in the central and southern half of the country.</span>
            <br><br>
            <span class="highlight1">Sweden</span> is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia. The climate is in
            general mild for its
            northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence. In spite of the high latitude, Sweden often
            has warm continental summers, being located in between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and vast
            Russia. The general climate and environment vary significantly from the south and north due to the vast
            latitudal difference, and much of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy winters. <br>
            <p style="text-decoration: underline">Southern Sweden is
                predominantly agricultural, while the north is heavily forested and includes a portion of the
                Scandinavian Mountains.</p>


            Germanic peoples have inhabited <span class="highlight1">Sweden</span> since prehistoric times, emerging
            into history as the Geats
            (Swedish Götar) and Swedes (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. An
            independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the Black Death in the middle of
            the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population,[21][22] the Hanseatic League
            threatened Scandinavia's culture, finances and languages. This led to the forming of the Scandinavian
            Kalmar Union in 1397,[23] which <span class="highlight1">Sweden</span> left in 1523. When <span
                class="highlight2">Sweden</span> became involved in the Thirty Years War
            on the Reformist side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the Swedish Empire was
            formed. This became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century. Swedish territories
            outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with
            the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly
            involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a personal union, which peacefully dissolved
            in 1905. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign
            affairs.[24] In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200 years of peace, breaking even Switzerland's record for
            peace.[25] Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars and the Cold War, albeit Sweden has since
            2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO.

            <strong>Sweden is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy</strong>, with legislative power
            vested in the
            349-member unicameral Riksdag. It is a unitary state, currently divided into 21 counties and 290
            municipalities. Sweden maintains a Nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and
            tertiary education for its citizens. <span class="highlight1"> It has the world's eleventh-highest per
                capita income and ranks
                very highly in quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, economic
                competitiveness, income equality, gender equality, prosperity and human development. </span><span

                History
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sweden's prehistory begins in the Allerød oscillation, a warm period around 12,000 BC,[35] with Late
                Palaeolithic reindeer-hunting camps of the Bromme culture at the edge of the ice in what is now the
                country's southernmost province, Scania. This period was characterized by small bands of
                hunter-gatherer-fishers using flint technology.[36]

                <b>Sweden is first described in a written source in Germania by Tacitus in 98 CE.</b> In Germania 44 and
                45
                he mentions the Swedes (Suiones) as a powerful tribe (distinguished not merely for their arms and men,
                but for their powerful fleets) with ships that had a prow at each end (longships). Which kings
                (kuningaz) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but Norse mythology presents a long line of legendary and
                semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the runic
                script was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century CE, but all that has
                come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names,
                demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke Proto-Norse at the time, a language ancestral
                to Swedish and other North Germanic languages.

                <span class="highlight2"><i>In the 6th century, Jordanes names two tribes living in Scandza, both of
                        which are now considered to be
                        synonymous with the Swedes:</i></span> the Suetidi and Suehans. Suetidi is considered to be the
                Latin form of
                Svíþjóð, the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the Suetidi and Dani as being of the same
                stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same
                stature.[40] The Suehans were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to
                Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the Thyringi of Germania (alia vero gens ibi moratur
                Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis). The Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson also wrote
                that the Swedish king Adils (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.

                The Vikings
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>The Swedish Viking</strong> Age lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is
                believed that
                Swedish Vikings and Gutar mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, Estonia, the Baltic
                countries, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Black Sea and even as far as Baghdad. Their routes passed
                through the Dnieper south to Constantinople, on which they carried out numerous raids. The Byzantine
                Emperor Theophilos noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal
                bodyguard, known as the Varangian Guard. The Swedish Vikings, called Rus are believed to be the founding
                fathers of Kievan Rus'.The Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan described these Vikings as follows:

                I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the Itil. I have never seen
                more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor
                caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man
                has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved,
                of Frankish sort.


                The Tjängvide image stone dating from 800 to 1099, example of Viking art
                The actions of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden, such as the Greece
                runestones and the Varangian runestones. There was also considerable participation in expeditions
                westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the England runestones. The last major Swedish
                Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of Ingvar the Far-Travelled to Serkland,
                the region south-east of the Caspian Sea. Its members are commemorated on the Ingvar runestones, none of
                which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of
                sickness
